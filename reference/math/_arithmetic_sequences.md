# Arithmetic

- Consec terms have a common diff [0,2,4,6]
- a = A[0], d = diff, n = # terms
- nth term of AP = a + (n-1) * d
                 = (n/2) * (A0+A1)

# Geometric

- Consec terms have a ratio [1,5,25,125]
- a = A0, r = ratio, n = #
- nth term = an = (a * r^(n-1))
- Sum of GP = Sn = a *

Harmonic

- Reciprocals form an arithmetic seq [1/2, 1/4, 1/6, 1/8]
- a = A0, d = diff
- nth term = an = 1 / (a + b^(n-1))
