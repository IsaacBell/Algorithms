# Triangles on a Square

Area of a ∆ = its base * its H, divided by 2

Let the 2 pts that have to be on the same side of a square form its base. To maximise it, choose the 2 pts that are farthest from each other: 1st and last in the list.

H = dist from that side to the remaining pt. Pts on the opp side are the furthest. So H is always 1 of H or W, depending on if we picked the horiz or the vertical side.

# Min Euclidean Dist

Divide & Conquer. Splits pts in half vertically.

Best ans so far is min dist pair from each half.

Take dist & make window from dist

dist | << orig >> | dist

Check w/in square of dimensions (dist x2 * dist)

# Area of a Regular Polygon

Area = (n-2)PI/PI, where n is # sides

Therefore, n = 2PI / PI - area

# Side-Angle-Side Postulate

2 ∆s are ~= if 2 sides of the ∆s, and the included angle btwn them, are ~=

# Angle-Side-Angle Postulate

If 2 angles and included side of ∆A are ~= to ∆B, ∆A ~= ∆B

# Hypotenuse-Leg Theorem

2 right ∆s are ~= if the hypotenuse and leg of ∆1 are ~= to the other

# Parallelograms

- All consec angles are supplementary
- Both pairs of opp sides are ~=
- The diagonals bisect each other
- If a quadrilateral has a pair of parallel ~= sides, then the lines are parallel
- If diagonals meet at right angles, you have a rhombus

# Trapezoids

- Only 2 sides are parallel
- Isosceles if 2 non-parallel sides

# Transversals

- Given 2 lines intercepted by a transversal, if a pair of corresponding angles are ~=, then the lines are parallel
- Interior angles on the same side of a transversal are supplementary
