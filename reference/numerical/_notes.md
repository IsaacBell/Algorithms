# Triangular Numbers

Sum of 1,2,...,N

Ex: 6 = 1+2+3

Formula: Tn = (n*(n+1)) / 2

## Sum of Reciprocals

Sum always = 2.

Ex: 1/1 + 1/3 + 1/6 + ... + 1/Tn = 2

# Oblong Numbers

Positive int of form n(n+1)

* nth oblong is sum of 1st n even #s
* Sum of odd ints is n^2
* 1 + a + a^2 + a^3 + a^(n-1) = (a^n - 1) / (a - 1)

# Deficient, Abundant, & Perfect Numbers

* Deficient: sum of n's factors < n
* Abundant: sum of n's factors > n
* Perfect #s: sum of n's factors = n
  * 6, 28, 496, 8128

# Mersenne Primes

* Even perfect #s all have form 2^(n-1) * (2^n - 1)

# Amicable Numbers

* for two ints a and b, the sum of factors of a = b and vice-versa

# Alternative Prime Check Technique

* To check if a # n is prime, see if it divides any # <= sqrt(n)

# Sum of 2 Squares

* Product of 2 sums of sqr #s is also the product of 2 sqr #s
* xy = (ac - bd)^2 + (ad + bc)^2 if x = (a^2 + b^2) & y = (c^2 + d^2)

# Sums

* n^3 = Sum of n consecutive odd #s from n^2 - n + 1 to n^2 - n + 2n - 1
* Sum of n oblong #s = (n * (n+1) * (n+2)) / 3
* Sum of 1st n triangular #s = (n * (n+1) * (n+2)) / 6
