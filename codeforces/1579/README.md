# Codeforces Round #744

## Problems

### A: Casimir's String Solitaire

*AC*

Checked whether # of occurrences of "B" was equal to "A" + "C". 

### B: Shifting Sort

*WA*

Correctly identified a solution, but failed at implementing it.

Need to finish practicing Sort problems on CSES to improve my time with these sorts of questions.

### C: Ticks

*(Not Submitted)*

Couldn't get Test Case 1 to pass. 

Solution passed some tests; it seems most likely that I misunderstood something in the prompt.

### D: Productive Meeting

*WA*
